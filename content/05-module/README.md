## 5.1 Planning - Refine the Goals and Requirements

### What you need to know

- At this point, you should have a working [project](../../projects/hivebox). It might not be perfect but good enough as start. Now it's time to start polishing it.
- First of all, you need to align with the business objectives. Is the project still relevant? Has the business changed direction, which requires changes in the tech side? Ensuring that the goals and requirements are aligned with the business means understanding the business context, market demands, and how you, as a DevOps engineer, can drive value to the company.
- OK, let's assume there have been no changes in the business directions. Now, it's essential to review the goals according to user feedback. You need to gather user feedback after using the first version of the solution you developed.
- Mostly, DevOps Engineers' users are other teams in the organization, but it could also be useful to get the end-users feedback via Product Owners/Managers.- You will refine your solution based on the business directions and user feedback. Establishing cross-functional collaboration with other teams (especially with the QA team) is also vital to ensure smooth end-to-end deliverability.
- From now on, you need to start building continuous feedback loops. They could have a simple structure, such as recutting meetings with different teams. We will cover this topic in detail in the next module.
- In general, planning should be considered a moving target. Goals should always be iterated to ensure they meet the requirements.
