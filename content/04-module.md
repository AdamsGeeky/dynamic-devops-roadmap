## 4.1 Planning - Review the Goals and Requirements

### What you need to know

- In the previous module, you should decided which Agile methodology you will use. You should create some sort of board to use (we will use [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)).
- At this point, you need to review the goals and requirements. In other words, what has been achieved and what do you want to achieve from this phase?
- The first thing is to define the work scope and deliverables to avoid scope creep and ensure all requirements will be met on time.
- After that, you set a realistic timeline of the work. For example, when you will work on the project and how much time do you allocate for it?
- Now you should `what` and `when` the next step is to communicate the plan and write it down in your project management platform (GitHub Projects in that case).
- It should be easy for any newcomer to understand the plan and to know its main directions.
- The next is to start working on the plan.

## 4.1 Code - Twelve-Factor App Methodology

### What you need to know

- In 2011 a manifest called [Twelve-Factor App methodology](https://12factor.net/) was introduced as a set of best practices for building modern, scalable, and maintainable web applications.
- The 12-factor app methodology is meant to standardize how applications should be developed to take full advantage of cloud environments.
- After more than a decade of that manifest, it's considered the minimal for all applications. You might not need to apply all of them, especially in a small code base, but they should be always in mind during architecting and implementation.
- Here we will just list the 12 factors, but ensure to read the page of each of them.
  1.  **Codebase**: One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys.
  2.  **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.
  3.  **Config**: Store config in the environment.
  4.  **Backing** services: Treat backing services as attached resources.
  5.  **Build, release, run**: Strictly separate build and run stages.
  6.  **Processes**: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes.
  7.  **Port binding**: Export services via port binding.
  8.  **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model.
  9.  **Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown.
  10. **Dev/prod parity**: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible.
  11. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams.
  12. **Admin processes**: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes.
- Remember, those are the bare minimum, and there are many other points to consider.
