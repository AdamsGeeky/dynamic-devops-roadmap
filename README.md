## The Problem

  <img align="right" width="30%" src="img/linear-devops-roadmap.png" />
</a>

The `DevOps Engineer` role remains one of the top 10 most in-demand jobs across all industries (not just the tech field!). However, starting that role is super challenging because the DevOps model has various patterns and topologies.

It's even more complicated if that's your first job without previous software industry experience (coming from either dev or ops).

For that reason, almost every day, I see people struggling on their way to start as fresh/junior DevOps engineers or even progress in their early career years in general. They usually follow some `linear` roadmap like [roadmap.sh/devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops)). But still, they cannot land their first job or straggle a lot when they find one! And sadly, many of them eventually give up!

## The Solution

  </a>
</p>

Based on my experience for years mentoring people in different stages (starting their first job, career shift, moving to another work style or company), I have found that the approach of using a `dynamic MVP-style roadmap` with hands-on projects designed by an experienced DevOps engineer has been highly successful. 

That means **each phase will cover all/most DevOps areas used in the job** to build a T-Shaped skills profile from day one! It's also essential to set the targeted market and organizations because with different DevOps topologies, the DevOps engineer role requirements vary a lot.


## Agile Board

One critical aspect of this roadmap is that it utilizes Agile methodologies like Epics and Kanban board to implement the plan, incorporating real-world scenarios and best practices, which you will use in a real job when working in an Agile environment. Not only that but DevSecOps is also already embedded in it!
